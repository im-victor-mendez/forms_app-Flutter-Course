# Forms App

> This is a learning application for the [BloC](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) state manager.
>
> It is part of the [Flutter Movil course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-cero-a-experto/) taught by Fernando Herrera.

By doing this application I learned to use, structure and model the BloC and Cubit state handlers.

It contains 3 main screens, two in which the two types of state handler are used and one in which Cubit and [Formz](https://pub.dev/packages/formz) are used together to create a complex form that is friendly with the UI/UX that is proposed for an application.
